# flappybird
Big Picture:

Flappy Bird was taken off the app store a number of years ago. i happened to enjoy the game but I had no jurisdiction over its success. Anyway I decided a few days ago thatI would like to play the game again. Thus, this project. I have decided that my flappy bird will not be identical to the one on the app store a few years ago. Rather I will make tweaks to my creativity such as changing the bird for a poptropica character because what kid doesn't like poptropica? Also one of the reasons I deleted the game was because of the backgroind -- it was always the same and became really boring. So I will incorporate different sceneries to make the game more entertaining. Perhaps there will be different game modes as well. Who knows???
The game I will create wil use pygame and will incorporate several things we have learned from class such as creaing a display, using images to make an icon, using other images to use it as the characater, and etc. There will be a menu screen where the different game modes are listed, there will be music and sounds. 

For the First round of the project I will have liked to gather pictures I want to use as the flappy bird and have incorporated them into the game. i also would like to have completed at least one of the sceneries by then. If I have completed both of those before the first round of the project is due I would like to start on the different froms of obstacles that you have to dodge.

The test plan for the first round:
The user will be introduced to the game where there will be a menu screen. The user will then be able to select whichever game modes I have managed to complete through a button. After clicking the button the user will be able to play the game in whichever mode they selected.
